Hi there, and thanks for visiting my little plugin.

This plugin, which I'm currently building, is intended for the Infactions.net server.
It will take some time and is far from done, but updates will be provided here.
I will also give a finished Jar once the plugin is finished, or you can just copy the repository and build the jar on your own.
